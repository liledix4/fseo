## What is SEO?

[Search Engine Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). Wikipedia:

> The process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines.

In my humble opinion, in 2025 and beyond, SEO is no longer necessary and businesses shouldn't invest too much in it or rely on it.

## Why is it a separate repository?

I mean, yeah, I could just create a directory in the [main website repository](https://github.com/liledix4/liledix4.github.io), but I was considering to put some techniques (example files) of two kinds:

1. Those that require taking care of SEO. Practices that can be avoided if you're aiming for better discoverability of your online resource, but in some occasions still could be helpful (you decide).
2. Those that replace SEO and more recommended to apply.

No solutions are timeless (the world never stays still), so all techniques require maintenance and updates.

## Are you any kind of SEO specialist or involved in marketing in any way?

No. I'm simply enthusiastic about some things. 🙃 So I highly recommend taking everything I say with a grain of salt. If you reasonably think any of the points provided are wrong, I'm completely open to your opinions! Thank you.
